Telemac simulation folder
------------------------------

To run HydroBayesCal using Telemac, you need to have Telemac installed in your PC and all the necesary files to run a hydrodynamic model.
First, create a folder called **telemac_simulation** and copy the necessary files for a Telemac simulation into it:
For example, for a hydrodynamic numerical model you might require:

- **telemac.cas:** Numerical configuration of the hydrodynamic model.
- **liquid.liq:** Liquid boundary condition (flow inflow/outflow) (in case of unsteady flow, a .liq file is needed)
- **boundary-conditions.cli:** File that defines the type and location of the boundary conditions.
- **geometry.slf:** File that defines the mesh structure for the hydrodynamic model.
- **zones.tbl:** File that defines the roughness zones of the mesh.
- **rating-curve.txt:**: File that defines the stage-discharge rating curve of the outlet boundary condition.

.. admonition:: Note

    - *Please, before starting any BAL calibration, check that your hydrodynamic model runs properly.*
    - *Until now, the code cannot run sediment transport model with GAIA. Only hydrodynamic simulations are possible.*

Definition of HydroBayesCal parameters
---------------------------------------

A complete surrogate assisted calibration of a hydrodynamic model requires the definition of some parameters corresponding to the complex model (e.g. Telemac or OpenFoam) and parameters for the metamodel construction based on Gaussian Process.

complex_model instance:

.. code-block:: python

    complex_model = initialize_model(
        TelemacModel(
            friction_file="/path/to/friction_file.tbl",
            tm_xd="1",
            gaia_steering_file="",
            results_filename_base="results",
            control_file="control_file.cas",
            model_dir="/path/to/model_directory/telemac_simulation",
            res_dir="/path/to/results_directory/",
            calibration_pts_file_path="/path/to/calibration_points.csv",
            n_cpus=8,
            init_runs=15,
            calibration_parameters=["zone1", "zone2", "zone3", "ROUGHNESS COEFFICIENT OF BOUNDARIES", ],
            param_values=[[0.011, 0.79], [0.011, 0.79], [0.0016, 0.060], [0.018, 0.028]],
            extraction_quantities=["WATER DEPTH", "SCALAR VELOCITY", "TURBULENT ENERGY", "VELOCITY U", "VELOCITY V"],
            calibration_quantities= ["WATER DEPTH", "SCALAR VELOCITY"]
            dict_output_name="output-data",
            user_param_values=False,
            max_runs=30,
            complete_bal_mode=True,
            only_bal_mode=False,
            delete_complex_outputs=True,
            validation=False
        )
    )


In this example, the **Telemac** files are saved in **telemac_simulation** folder. The path to this folder is defined in ``model_dir``.
.. code::

    model_dir="/path/to/model_directory/telemac_simulation".

The prior assumptions for these uncertain calibration parameters are defined as four ranges in ``param_values`` following a uniform distribution limited by the minimum and maximum limits. The model is calibrated for three roughness zones and the roughness coefficients of the boundaries.
.. code::

    param_values=[[0.011, 0.79], [0.011, 0.79], [0.0016, 0.060], [0.018, 0.028]].

The measured data, stored in a `.csv` file, should consists of water depth and scalar velocity. Each of these quantities has a measurement error which is also assigned in the corresponding column in the .csv file. These quantities will be the calibration targets and are extracted from the model. The user-specified ``calibration_quantities``are ["WATER DEPTH", "SCALAR VELOCITY"].
.. code::

    calibration_quantities=["WATER DEPTH", "SCALAR VELOCITY"]

For more details on the assignment of complex model parameters, please refer to the section :ref:`HydroSimulations_class`.


Experiment Design Definition
----------------------------

The calibration model parameters are associated with uncertainty and are described as probability distributions.
To define the values of the input parameters, **HydroBayesCal** uses the classes `ExpDesigns` and `Input` from BayesValidRox:
`Priors, input space and experimental design <https://pages.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/inversemodeling/bayesvalidrox/input_description.html>`_

If the uncertain parameters are defined as distribution types, they must be specified as follows:

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    exp_design = setup_experiment_design(
        complex_model=full_complexity_model,
        tp_selection_criteria='dkl',
        parameter_distribution='uniform',
        parameter_sampling_method='sobol'
    )

This function returns an instance of the ``ExpDesigns`` class from BayesValidRox,
which will be used in subsequent steps.

The attribute ``exp_design.X`` stores the collocation points for the initial execution of the complex model.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

**complex_model** : object
    An instance representing the hydrodynamic model to be used in the experiment.

**tp_selection_criteria** : str, optional
    The criteria for selecting new training points (TP) during the Bayesian Active Learning process.
    Default: ``'dkl'`` (relative entropy).

    Available options:
    * **"dkl"** - Relative Entropy (Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence).
    * **"bme"** - Bayesian Model Evidence (LHS).

**parameter_distribution** : str, optional
    The criteria for selecting the parameter distribution.
    Default: ``'uniform'`` (uniform distribution).

**parameter_sampling_method** : str, optional
    The criteria for selecting the parameter sampling method.
    Default: ``'sobol'``.

   Available options:

   * **"random"** - Random sampling.
   * **"latin_hypercube"** - Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).
   * **"sobol"** - Sobol sequence sampling.

Run Complex Model with Experiment Design
-----------------------------------------

This step executes the hydrodynamic model for a given experiment design and returns
the collocation points (previously obtained in the experiment design) and the model outputs.
The collocation points serve as the input parameters for the initial model runs.

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    init_collocation_points, model_evaluations = run_complex_model(
        complex_model=complex_model,
        experiment_design=exp_design,
    )

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

**complex_model** : obj
    Instance representing the hydrodynamic model to be evaluated.

**experiment_design** : obj
    Instance of the experiment design object that specifies the settings for the experimental runs.

Returns
^^^^^^^^

**collocation_points** : array
    Contains the collocation points (parameter combination sets) with shape
    ``[number of runs x number of calibration parameters]`` used for model evaluations.

**model_outputs** : array
    Contains the model outputs. The shape of the array depends on the number of quantities:

    - **For 1 quantity**: ``[number of runs x number of locations]``
    - **For 2 quantities**: ``[number of runs x 2 * number of locations]``
      *(Each pair of columns contains the two quantities for each location.)*

Run Bayesian Active Learning Calibration
----------------------------------------

This step performs **stochastic calibration** of the Telemac hydrodynamic model using
**Surrogate-Assisted Bayesian Inversion**. The surrogate model is constructed with
**Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)**, supporting both **Single-Output GP** and **Multi-Output GP** formulations.

This approach enables:

- **Bayesian Model Inversion**, allowing uncertainty quantification of model input parameters
  through **Bayesian Inference**.
- **Iterative surrogate training**, where the GP metamodel is refined dynamically by adding new training points using
  **Bayesian Active Learning (BAL)** to improve calibration efficiency. The criteria for adding new training points is selected from **DKL (relative entropy)**, **BME (Bayesian Model Evidence)**
- **Methods by:** `Oladyshkin et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.3390/e22080890>`_.

Surrogate-Assisted BAL Calibration Outputs
-------------------------------------------

The surrogate-assisted Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) calibration runs iteratively until the specified ``max_runs`` limit is reached.
Once the calibration process is completed, the output files are generated and organized into separate folders based on the type of data.

.. image:: _static/output-folders.png
   :alt: Post-calibration output folders
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

Each folder contains essential data that can be extracted or used for further analysis.
The generated folders and their contents are as follows:

**1. Calibration Data**
   Contains all calibration-related data for the specified calibration quantity/quantities.

   - **``BAL_dictionary.pkl``**:

     Bayesian Model Evidence (BME), and Relative Entropy (RE).

   - **``collocation-points-<CALIBRATION_QUANTITY>.csv``**:
     Lists the collocation points used during calibration, including both initial and BAL-added points for the specified ``<CALIBRATION_QUANTITY>``.

   - **``extraction-data-detailed.json``**:
     A JSON dictionary containing the output data from the complex model simulations for all collocation points
     and the variables in ``extraction_quantities``.

   - **``model-results-calibration-<CALIBRATION_QUANTITY>.csv``**:
     A CSV file storing model results for all collocation points and the specified ``<CALIBRATION_QUANTITY>``.

**2. Plots**
   This folder stores plots generated after the calibration process.
   The Python script **``plots.py``** is used to create these plots.

**3. Surrogate Models**
   Contains surrogate models developed during the calibration process. Inside this folder a subfolder will be created depending on the training point selection criteria.
   Inside the corresponding folder the surrogate models are saved as **pickle** files for further use.

   - **bal_bme**: Folder that stores the surrogate models trained with BME criteria.
   - **bal_dkl**: Folder that stores the surrogate models trained with DKL criteria.

**4. Restart Data**
   Stores data necessary for resuming the calibration process or stores independent sets of parameters with their respective outputs for surrogate validation.
   The following files are typically included:

    For resuming BAL calibration process:

    These files allow the continuation of the BAL calibration process. This is the training data for the initial surrogate model before BAL iterations.
    It is possible also to build the surrogate model with either **ALL** the restart data or just a **PART** of it. To use only a part of it, initialize the ``initial_runs`` with the desired number of initial training ponts.
   - **``initial-collocation-points.csv``**:
     Contains the initial parameter combinations used for surrogate training and further BAL calibration..
     The number of collocation points corresponds to the value assigned in ``init_runs``.

   - **``initial-outputs.json``**:
     A JSON dictionary storing initial outputs (defined in ``extraction_quantities``) from the full-complexity model at the collocation points.

   - **user-collocation-points.csv**:
     Contains the initial user-defined parameter combinations used for surrogate training and further BAL calibration.

     For validating surrogate model with independent collocation points:

   - **``collocation-points-validation.csv``**: Contains the parameter combinations used for surrogate validation, independent of the training data.
   - **``collocation-points-validation.json``**: Stores the corresponding model outputs associated with the validation collocation points.
   - **``model-results-validation.csv``**: Contains the model outputs obtained from evaluating the validation collocation points, used for assessing the surrogate model's accuracy.
